# P-ESCA
Code for the P-ESCA routine 
These folders contain the implementation of pESCA (penalized exponential family simultaneous component analysis) model with various concave penalties in both R and Matlab. The pESCA model with the group concave (concave L2 norm) penalty is applied in the paper "Separating common (global and local) and distinct variation in multiple mixed types data sets", https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06241.
